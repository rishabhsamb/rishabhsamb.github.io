At Tesla, I work on Autobidder, a software system that controls the dispatch of energy
from huge batteries (Tesla Megapacks) to the power grid based on demand, attempting to
maximize profit for whoever owns the battery (99% of the time this is a renewable energy
producer). This keeps renewable energy sources cheap and profitable; this makes them
more attractive than natural gas or fossil fuels. This is a team that will, as according
to the Tesla slogan, accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.

Along with this, I get to use a fun functional language in Scala, and work on 
occasionally interesting problems like scaling machine learning inference to be fast enough
to operate on real-time markets, and occasionally boring little data pipelines to facilitate 
accurate revenue reporting.

Why then, do I still feel unhappy with the work I do? I believe most factors to be internal,
with simple solutions rooted in necessary perspective shifts.

## ego and money
Most of the time this comes from trying to get a 'better' job than the one I have now. Better
in the sense that it's more prestigious, or it pays more, or has better work life balance.

Much of this comes from the fear that I'll fall too far 'behind'. Behind what? I see my peers
in school as other avenues in life that were open to me. If they work at a place with double or
triple my compensation, then that's a failure on my part.

Some of this concern is practical; money is practical up to maybe 5 million. If I had 1 million dollars in
my bank account, would I be more okay with working on this problem? I think the number is 5, but I don't
know if I'd shift the goalposts.

Maybe I just want to sell out. 

## intellect
I know that software engineering is an intellectual pursuit. I know that data pipelines aren't "beneath me";
I can barely even write good ones myself. I can't help feel that the work I'm "meant" to do is supposed to
be less building and more discovery, but I can't come up with a good reason besides that.

With the onset of AGI, is intellect even a good marker of success? I believe that to be stale, but maybe that
implies that, in the limit, I believe all intellectual work to be overtaken by AGI.
